# Stack Data Structure
This Folder contains the basic queue data structure. Please note that I have tried to keep it dynamic by using template feature that means you can use this queue for any data type by explicitly declaring it at the time of queue creation.

# NOTE
This is not a circular Queue just a basic linear queue. so you can encounter problems if the front pointer is matched or exceeds the position of rear.
