# Stack Data Structure
This Folder contains the basic queue data structure. Please note that I have tried to keep it dynamic by using template feature that means you can use this queue for any data type by explicitly declaring it at the time of queue creation.

# NOTE
This is a Dynamic circular Queue. so you won't encounter any problems that arise with the usage of a basic queue.
